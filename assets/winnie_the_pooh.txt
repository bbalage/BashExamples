Once upon a time, Winnie the Pooh was happy. Then, Piglet came to his house and showed him MINTA ZH from the course Mathematical Analysis. Then, Winnie the Pooh could say he was happy anymore. Not very happy at all.

Piglet said that they should study, because they will fail the course. However, Winnie the Pooh decided that he would go the pub instead to forget about the Analysis, and be happy again.

Piglet studied and succeeded the ZH, while Winnie the Pooh grew a SÃ¶rhas being happy. In the end both of them were happy.
